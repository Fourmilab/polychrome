Fourmilab Polychrome for Second Life

Fourmilab Polychrome is a general-purpose and flexible script which may installed in the inventory of any object, whether a simple prim, link set of multiple prims, or mesh object.  It allows you to specify a set of prims and faces (by default all) within the object which smoothly change between randomly selected colours specified as a range within either the RGB (red-green-blue) or HSV (hue-saturation-value) colour systems.  You can select whether each prim and/or face has its own individual colour or all are coloured uniformly.  The script can be configured to broadcast colours to scripts installed in other objects belonging to the same user in the local region.  This allows “colour co-ordinating” different items, for example, a dress, hat, and shoes attached to the same avatar, so that all change together identically.

The script can be configured by sending it commands in Local Chat or by including a notecard in the object containing the script which contains the same commands used in the chat.  Although the script is provided with full permissions and you're free to modify it as you wish, you can normally use the standard script, configuring it appropriately with a notecard in the object where it's installed.

As a script, installing Fourmilab Polychrome in an object has no land impact.  The demonstration objects included with the script have the land impact of the number of prims of which they are composed.

The garments shown in this listing are only for illustration and are not included in this item.  You can purchase them from their creators via the Second Life Marketplace links of:

The dress in image 1 was used as-is.  The dress and hat in image 2 were modified by replacing the textures supplied with “bleached” versions made by converting colours to grey scale.  In image 2, the Polychrome script in the dress broadcasts its colour changes to the one in the hat, allowing both to change together.

Three demonstration objects using the script are included: a simple cube (land impact 1), a stellated icosahedron (land impact 20) where you can colour every face independently, each tetrahedron independently, or the entire object uniformly, and a collection of cubes (land impact 13)  placed at the vertices of an icosahedron.  All of the demonstration objects can be set to spin locally to better show their colours.  The demonstration objects are documented in an included README notecard.  Note that while these demonstrations require land and have land impact, the Polychrome script itself has no land impact and can be added to any object (such as a garment you're wearing) with no land or impact.
