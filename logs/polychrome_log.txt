                        Development Log

2020 February 24

Created local development Git repository in:
    ~/w/SecondLife/Polychrome/git
with:
    git init

Added:
    Special files (README.md, etc.)
    Scripts
    Logs (this file)
    Notecards (User Guide / Help file)
    Tools

Reorganised the marketplace/images/development directory so that
the raw screen grabs and crops will not clutter up the Git
repository.  
   
Added:
    Marketplace (listing text, images)

Made initial commit of files.

Logged on to github.com.

Created a new repository:
    polychrome
with access URLs:
    HTTPS: https://github.com/Fourmilab/polychrome.git
    SSH:   git@github.com:Fourmilab/polychrome.git

Pushed the production directory to the repository with:
    git remote add origin git@github.com:Fourmilab/polychrome.git
    git push -u origin master

Confirmed that my local "git sync" command works with the remote
repository.
